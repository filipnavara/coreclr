# mono-proxy

The purpose of this project is to generate a compatible mono.dll (in the project `mono-proxy`) that is exposing all the functions exposed by mono for Unity.

This emulation layer allows us to log the actual functions used by an Unity application.

The `mono-proxy\monoproxy.cpp` is automatically generated by the project `MonoProxyCodeGen` parsing the `MonoFunctions.h` from Unity.
